# Google Data Analytics Capstone:
## Cyclicstic Trip Data Case Study

### Introduction

#### Sources:

### Ask
Analyze and compare the usage patterns of annual members and casual riders on Cyclistic bikes to identify key differences in their behavior.

This will involve examining data on frequency, duration, and timing of bike usage for both groups to inform strategies for marketing and pricing to encourage membership.

### Act
Due to the high seasonality of the pattern of the casual riders, I would recommend a voucher or tiered pass-type schema where the member may choose to either have an unlimited (yearly) membership that they pay annually or monthly, but could also have daily/weekly or ride count passes (2-ride, 5-ride, 10-ride, etc.) 
As we see a spike in May, running a Summer special in March/April to capture the momentum that already exists and make it easier for those people who are already going to be using the service to access especially if discount.
Daily average ridership patterns point towards "end-of-week" usage being most common between both members and casual riders. Casual riders most commonly having maximum average daily rides on Sunday and members on Thursday. We could drive ridership by focusing on our weekend traffic for members, as they are already riding most towards the end of the week, try to keep the momentum, and encouraging casual ridership during the week. This could be possible with a special member-only "week-end" deal (Th-Sun.)

Encouraging membership by providing accomodating plan options, fostering continued casual ridership, and rewarding member usage during off-times can help push us towards a conservative goal of 70% membership by next year.
